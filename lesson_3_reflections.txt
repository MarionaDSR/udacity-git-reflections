When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want/need to share my project with other contributors, when I want to access my contents from 
and other computer or when I want to have a copy of the in a saver place than my computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

As said for when to commit, I need to choose when is a good moment to share my contents.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork makes a copy for me on GitHub from an other repository on GitHub (mine or not), and keeps mine linked to the original one. When I commit, I commit on MY fork.
Clone makes a copy on my pc from a repository on GitHub. When I commit, I commit on the original repository.
Branches works at local. I can make a branche to work on a specific subject of my project, and later, merge it into the trunk.
